### MARCO VERDE

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">**aka "Verdem"**</span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Hi, my name is Marco and I am quite good at creating various types of websites and applications that can serve everyone, not just a few people. I also create content on YouTube.  

My adventure in the Internet field began on December 25, 2014, I created my channel (Verdem) that is still active but I took it almost like a game, in the meantime I had fun uploading videos that were fun for me: translations of popular videos that ran on YouTube, GamePlay, commentary and parodies. Around 2019 things started to get serious with Copyright and various things so I saw a turning point needed: I started making videos according to what people liked, and of course me too. The desire to create something useful for people led me to create an application repository on my first serious website. We arrive at the beginning of 2020: I have 420 subscribers on YouTube, a Twitter, a Discord server and a blog along with all the other projects I have done.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Initially this blog was born as a place where I could share what I knew with you and in fact remained so except that now I translate, search and write to post.</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">**[Email Forwarding](https://verforward.blogspot.com/)**</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">This project started with a question: can you create a completely free service without registration for email forwarding? The answer was simple and in fact immediately after finding a way to make it, I got to work!</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">**[Your Blog](https://veryourblog.blogspot.com/)**</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">This project, like EmailForwarding, started from a simple question: since it's not easy to create a blog, why don't I create one and think of a way to publish content from any person? I also found the answer here and I started.</div>
