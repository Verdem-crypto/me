# INTRODUCTION

### MARCO VERDE

aka "Verdem"

Hi, my name is Marco and I am a student in Italy, I am quite good at creating various types of websites, I also create content on YouTube.  

My adventure in the Internet field began on December 25, 2014, I created my channel (Verdem) that is still active, in the meantime I had fun uploading videos that were fun for me. Around 2019 things started to get serious with Copyright and various things so I saw a turning point needed: I started making videos according to what people liked, and of course me too. The desire to create something useful for people led me to create an application repository on my first serious website. We arrive at the beginning of 2020: I have 430 subscribers on YouTube, a Discord server and a blog, I made a song, PartyBeats, the song that I and GreenFire003 created. In my spare time I like to learn more about PHP and JavaScript and do stupid things on YouTube.
